                        <p>
                         I will love <strong>you for the rest of our lives </strong>I don't deny that there are many things I don't know about the world<em> But I know almost everything... </em> about you<em> I know you love to eat</em> I know you never give up and you always get back up. I know you love white flowers, And I know you can draw great strength from the people you care about! You don't have to make your mind and heart believe that you are alone, And don't let your inner child believe that you are alone. <code> because you are not alone</code> What makes you believe that your little self wants to be alone? <strong> Has she ever said that's what she wants?</strong> Let me bring back your little self <strong> And tell her that I will be there for her and I will never leave her.</strong> Because I want something serious and real with you. No matter what problems we face, I will always choose you in this life, and if there were more, I would choose you in all of them. I just want to make you happy, take care of you, protect you, value you, respect you and, above all, always be with you. <br> <strong>:P</strong>♡<em></em>. <br><strong></strong> <strong></strong><br><br> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: grey;">Do you want to be my girlfriend? </span> <br> <code></code>
